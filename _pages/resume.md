## Work Experience

### **Siemens**
*Sr. Machine learning Engineer* (*May 2021 - Present*)
- Currently working on contamination prevention at vaccine production workbench by detecting 3D Human Pose from Lidar feeds and restricting human movement on the basis of speed and co-worker proximity. (Client - GSK)
- Custom object detection pipeline to detect faulty clip placements on automotive dashboards (Client - Faurecia)
- Attention based U-Net to detect alpha-numeric text from drum-disks (Client - Munjal)

### **Orbo.ai**
*Computer Vision Engineer* (*October 2019 - May 2021*)
- Lead the Face Recognition project for Mumbai Metro (MMRDA) 
Literature survey and training models from scratch with large-scale data along with OpenVINO optimization and hardware setup.
Data augmentation to tackle racial bias (specific to Indian faces) and low lighting without sacrificing LFW accuracy (99.3%)
- Face detection model on the lines of LFFD (A Light and Fast Face Detector for Edge Devices) for real-time crowd monitoring.
- Packaged deep learning models (SR, face mask detection, social distance monitoring etc.) into production level C++ SDKs for clients oriented towards deployment on edge devices like routers (Client - Cisco)
- Created Super Resolution models using Residual Dense Block architecture for entertainment industry and mobile phones (lightweight models by pruning and quantization) 
- Created benchmarking tools to assess model performance in terms of VMAF, PSNR, SSIM etc. for super resolution applications

### **Yrals Digital Pvt. Ltd.**
*Developer Python | Machine Learning* (*March 2017 - October 2019*)
-  Developed **TV Feed Analyzer** an automated commercial extraction and story segregation platform based on broadcast video (news feed) for Times Now and Zee News(Zee Hindi and Wion) by deploying:
1. Machine learning techniques (HOG+LSTM, CNNs, PCA, linear regression) for anchor detection, face recognition, scrolling text band detection etc.
2. Traditional CV methods (shot detection, Hough Line transform) for scene classification, footage box detection  etc.
3.  Audio analysis (MFCC based Voice Activity Detection)
- Built scalable back-end from scratch for "TV Feed Analyzer" using AWS Lambda, EC2 and Mongo DB (system design, DB architecture, cron automation etc.)
- Deployed end to end machine learning pipelines on AWS
- Found solutions to problems in the video processing domain to optimize workflow and avoid bottle necks related to speed as well as compute costs on AWS (multi-processing in serverless environment)
- Joined as junior Python Developer to produce maintainable and well documented code for analytical and research-oriented problems related to computer vision, audio and video processing

### **MATLAB Helper** 
*MATLAB Developer* (*July 2016 - August 2016*)

Advanced MATLAB Project implementation dealing with:
- Image Processing
- Machine Readable Zone Detection
- Optical Character Recognition and other important topics related to physics
- Writing tutorials and code (in MATLAB) spanning concepts such as Monte Carlo simulation, Harris corner detection, Radon transform, etc.
