<p>Over the course of this year, as I got deeper into Machine Learning and Computer Vision, I started to come across posts and comments advising folks new to programming in general to create a blog detailing their experiences.</p>
<p>Most posts/people summed up the benefits of creating such a blog along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are presently in the best position to help along another newcomer who is a few steps behind you. This is because the issues you came across and the mistakes you made are still fresh in your mind and the resources you consulted to overcome/correct those issues/mistakes are still fresh in you mind and close to hand.</li>
<li>It is generally agreed that writing about a topic helps deepen your understanding of the topic and force you to address the gaps in your knowledge.</li>
<li>You write for totally selfish reasons. You write for posterity. You write for your future self.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the schools of thought I was exposed to while learning programming and my personal way of doing things, my code is always littered with detailed and sometimes superfluous comments. Thus, I initially assumed that all I needed to do was put all my comments for a project together, edit and format them into a coherent document, and voila!, blog post.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the various resources I found online for creating simple blogs were overly involved and required knowledge of html and other web-related stuff of which I knew nothing. Furthermore, I wasn't interested in going off on a tangent when my focus is <code>Machine Learning</code> and <code>Computer Vision</code>. I also came across <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> at this point but it was more of the same.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>So, I gave up on creating a blog and stuck to writing detailed comments in my code.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple months after, I took <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai's</a> <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a> online course. At some point in Lesson 3, when <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward">Jeremy Howard</a> started going on about writing and blogs, in my mind I went "Here we go again." Then he introduced <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages">fastpages</a> and it was all I ever needed.{% include youtube.html content='<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3Ao5KuCC4?start=3441">https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3Ao5KuCC4?start=3441</a>' %}</p>

<p><code>fastpages</code> is an easy to use blogging platform, with support for Jupyter notebooks, Word documents, and Markdown.</p>

<p>Once you're done with the intial setup, you'll get a generic blog that contains a few placeholders from <code>fastbook</code>. There are a few simple customizations you can make to put your personal stamp on your blog.</p>
<p>These customizations can be implemented across <code>four files</code> and <code>one folder</code> in the  newly forked blog repository. I will list the files and the personalizations that can be done in each.</p>

The picture below shows the code and the result in the homepage.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Outsiders17711/Mein.Platz/main/images/ipynb/index_html.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Two sets of changes can be made in this file:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Line 4</em>: The blog logo by sepecified by a file placed in the <code>images</code> folder of the base directory. This is the image preview automatically shown with your blog URL on social media sites. You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>replace the fastpages logo with one of your own choosing, leaving <code>Line 4</code> as it is; or</li>
<li>add you own file to the <code>images</code> folder and edit the filename in <code>Line 4</code>.
{% include important.html content='The image for the blog logo MUST be in the <strong>images</strong> folder (or subfolders) for your blog to render correctly.' %}    </li>

<p>Two sets of changes can be made to this file:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Line 6</em>: You can totally remove that line, thus removing the <code>View Demo Site</code> badge. On the other hand, you might want to change it to one of your choosing and make it point to another link.</p>
<p>This is quite simple. The <a href="https://shields.io/">shields.io</a> developer site contains example code on how to create your own custom badges. If you want to use a shield logo other than the ones available, you need to convert your .png to base64 code, you can't just specify a path to the .png file. <a href="https://b64.io/">b64.io</a> is a free resource for converting images to base64 format. The logo is then specified in the badge code using the snippet below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>?logo=data:image/png;base64,…
</pre></div>
<p>You can consult the answers provided to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38985050/how-do-i-use-the-logo-option-in-shields-io-badges">stackoverflow question</a> if you have any difficulty creating you custom badge.

<ol>
<li><em>Line 9</em>: This controls the title of the blog found at the top of the homepage. It is freely customizable.</li>
<li><em>Line 10</em>: This controls the blog description at the very bottom of the homepage. It is freely customizable.</li>

<p>Here are some other advanced customizations you can carry out. They are advanced in the sense that you need to go through the documentation of the various resources used by fastpages in order to figure out to to modify them.</p>
<p>At this point, you'll be diverging greatly from the default <code>fastpages</code> setup for your blog, thus you'll need to modify/add multiple files to successfully make a modification.</p>

<p>This is all I have for now. Hope you found the post useful. I plan to keep updating this post until I'm done tweaking the looks of this blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>I just want to add that I created two draft versions of this post:one in <a href="https://outsiders17711.github.io/Outsiders17711.FastPages/blog/Setting-Up-This-Blog/">jupyter notebook</a> and the other in <a href="https://outsiders17711.github.io/Outsiders17711.FastPages/drafts/Draft-Setting-Up-This-Blog/">markdown</a>. I found the notebook version more comfortable to work with and the final output better looking than the markdown version.</p>
